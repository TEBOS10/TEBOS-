# Operator log

The build loop's record, newest first. See [`OPERATOR.md`](OPERATOR.md) for the rules each run follows.

## Founder's decisions (only you can unblock these)

Update this list every run; strike items when they're done.

| # | Decision | What it unblocks |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Paystack secret key on the worker, and the webhook `https://tebos-worker-production.up.railway.app/webhooks/paystack` | Taking the first payment, and monthly invoices |
| 2 | Resend key and a verified sending domain | Every client email: payment links, contracts, invoices, reminders |
| 3 | A lawyer approves the contract templates (standard and company) and advises on POPIA | Signing clients |
| 4 | Activate the 9 draft objectives on TEBOS's board | The company measuring itself, and the maintainer queue watching TEBOS |
| 5 | Founder name and title for outreach and the site | Sending the outreach drafts |
| 6 | Social accounts created | Publishing the social pack |
| 7 | Company registration and VAT number | Invoices that are legally complete |
| 8 | Make the repo private, rotate database passwords, turn on leaked-password protection | Protecting the platform from copying |

## 30 Sep 2026: loop started

- Built: this loop. It has standing orders (`OPERATOR.md`), this log, and `scripts/local-pg.sh`, so a
  fresh session can run the database tests from nothing.
- Live before this run: the pipeline, the sales team pack, the company board, the company plan, the self-check,
  monthly billing, and the maintainer queue (PR #20). The worker's first maintenance scan of TEBOS ran at
  14:15 UTC and raised nothing, because all of TEBOS's objectives are still drafts (decision 4).
- Next by the rules: the build order in `ROADMAP.md` → "TEBOS on its own board" item 3, marketing and PR drafting
  with approval before publishing.
